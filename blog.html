    <h1>Python tutorial</h1>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, this is my tutorial for python. <br />
      To start install PyCharm with your calpoly student email and write
      print("Hello world") and then you are done.
      <br />
      Lately, I've been seeing a lot of complaints on the blog for not teaching
      well, so I have opened up <a href="form.html">this form</a> for you to
      voice your complaints.
